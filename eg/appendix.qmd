title: "Code in appendix"
execute:
  echo: true

My preferred approach, reusing named chunks, does not work in jupyter,
only in knitr:

However, you can I think use functions before defining them, see e.g.


# Example

Let's use our function

```{julia}
addone(10)
```


# Appendix

Here is the definiton of my function


```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| label: def
function addone(x)
    x+1
end
```
