Order is approximate and could change

Incomplete, still more to write about, including
- String manipulation
- Macros and code generation
- Perhaps choose some packages to write about

Would also be nice to have some case studies, don't know what format yet
- Sum of integers 1 to 1000 seemed to work well
- Ordering a list
- Root finding or similar numerical methods
- For more complicated examples we might be able to reuse one from the CATAM project
